## About The Project

**Why it started:**

During my senior year, I was presented with the opportunity to have the experience of managing a resourse fund for academic purposes. I was shocked to find out that there was not a free tool that could help me filter publicly traded companies through a wide range of ratios, indexes and fundamental/quantitative data. Therefore, I created Apollo, with the hope of providing students, investors and finance enthusiasts the ability to have a powerful software to help them throough their financial research.

**Learn more about Apollo**
